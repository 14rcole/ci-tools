# This YAML file demonstrates copying an input tag to an output tag after
# running a test. It is expected to be run with promote. It is used to gate
# including an external image into a integration stream for testing before
# promotion.
#
# test with:
#
#   JOB_SPEC='{}' ci-operator --config test/testdata/copy_input_tag_to_output.yaml \
#       --target example --target [output:stable:cli] \
#       --promote
#
# This should:
# 1. Copy the 4.0 image stream tag into stable:cli
# 2. Override stable:cli with the 4.1:cli image.
# 3. If example passes, promote stable:cli (4.1) to test-1/example:cli
